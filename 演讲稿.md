**In the first user study**, the performance of HandyCast was compared with the Go-Go technique and the Tiltcasting method. This within-subjects study involved tasks where participants had to select and place objects as quickly as possible. Notably, despite similar task completion times to the Go-Go technique, HandyCast required significantly less physical motion and control space, while participants experienced comparable body ownership.

**In a second study**, conducted in a space-constrained environment, HandyCast was compared with an adjusted version of the Go-Go technique. This mixed-design study demonstrated that HandyCast not only outperformed the Space-Constrained Go-Go in terms of task completion time but also required less interaction volume and path length. Impressively, HandyCast maintained performance levels comparable to the non-constrained Go-Go technique, even under these limited conditions.

**Regarding tracking evaluation**, the performance of HandyCast using both external tracking via HTC VIVE and internal tracking using ARKit was assessed. Despite some drift with the phoneâ€™s built-in tracking, participants effectively compensated for this, leading to no significant difference in task completion times between the two tracking methods. This suggests that while HandyCast can operate with built-in phone tracking, enhancements are advisable to reduce drift.

**To conclude**, the evaluation results establish HandyCast as a viable solution for VR interaction in various physical space conditions. It drastically reduces the required physical motion and control space in constrained environments and maintains interaction performance comparable to traditional bimanual controller techniques.

**The technical contributions** of HandyCast include transforming a smartphone into a multifunctional VR controller compatible with existing VR applications. This not only extends the usability of VR technology but also offers new possibilities for mobile VR interaction.

**Looking forward**, there are several avenues for future research:

- **Improvements in Tracking Technology**: Enhancing the accuracy and stability of built-in tracking.
- **Parameterization and Personalization**: Allowing users to customize pose and touch transfer parameters for a tailored experience.
- **Design for Complex Interactions**: Extending HandyCast to support more complex interactions using multiple touch points.
- **Compensation for Long-Term Tracking Drift**: Addressing drift issues over extended use through dynamic updates or additional sensor data.

**In summary**, HandyCast represents a significant advancement in VR technology by using smartphone as an input device. It reduces the dependency on external tracking hardware and the need for expansive physical spaces, making VR more accessible and practical in various settings.

Through comprehensive user studies and tracking evaluations, HandyCast has proven its effectiveness and laid the groundwork for further improvements and broader application in the VR field.
